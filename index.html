        &emsp;I am a Virginia Tech sophomore computer science student passionate about technology. I have four years of experience in programming. I was in <a href="https://careercenter.apsva.us/arlington-tech/">Arlington Tech highschool</a>, a program focused on project-based learning.

I know how to program in three different languages: Python, Java, and C. Throughout my two years in college I have written many school projects including a social media visualizer that online creators can use to track their viewership, a whack-a-mole game, a Tower of Hanoi solver and many more.
