    <p class="paragraph-padding">
        &emsp;As a creative individual, I am passionate about the field of graphic design and have had relevant professional experience through my summer internship as a graphic designer for a motivational speaker/journalist. During my time there, I was responsible for creating logos, icons, presentations, banners, brochures, and information pages. This experience, along with my Adobe certification for Photoshop and Illustrator, which I earned during high school, has fueled my desire to pursue a career in this field.<br>

        &emsp;However, my aspirations extend beyond graphic design. I am also interested in programming for more creative fields, such as game and app design. To achieve these goals, I plan to take specific classes and continue honing my skills. My personal and professional values of creativity, attention to detail, and dedication will make me a competent and valuable asset in any position I hold within this industry. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am eager to contribute my talents and passion to any potential employer.
